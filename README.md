üìÑ REVIEWER RECOMMENDER:
This repository contains the code for a Research Paper Reviewer Recommender application. This system recommends the top expert reviewers for an uploaded research paper (PDF) based on the semantic similarity between the paper's content and the reviewers' past publications (expertise corpus).

üöÄ FeaturesSemantic Matching: Uses sentence embeddings generated by the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model to calculate cosine similarity between the uploaded paper and the corpus of reviewer papers.


PDF Processing: Extracts text from an uploaded PDF using a robust approach (combining PyMuPDF and Apache Tika).


Author Exclusion: Automatically filters out authors of the uploaded paper from the list of potential reviewers to ensure fair recommendations.


Streamlit Interface: Provides a simple, interactive web application for easy use.


üìÅ Repository Structure

The core files provided serve the following purposes:

File NameDescription


app.py :The main Streamlit web application script. Handles PDF upload, text extraction, model loading, similarity calculation, and result display.
embedding_generator.py : A utility script used to load the processed expertise data, generate sentence embeddings for each paper using SentenceTransformer, and save the result to semantic_recommender.pkl.


pdf_parser.py : A utility script used to walk through the raw PDF dataset, extract text and metadata (author name, paper title) from each PDF, and save the output to reviewer_expertise_data.csv.


requirements.txt: Lists all necessary Python packages and their versions for running the project.


reviewer_expertise_data.csv: The pre-processed dataset containing one row per paper, including the author_name and the extracted expertise_corpus (paper text).


semantic_recommender.pkl: The pre-trained file containing all reviewer paper embeddings and corresponding author names, used by app.py for semantic recommendation.


tfidf_recommender.pkl: A placeholder or legacy file, likely containing a pre-trained TF-IDF vectorizer model for an alternative recommendation strategy (not actively used in the provided app.py).
